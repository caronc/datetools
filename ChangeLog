# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.3] - 2018-05-31
### Changed
- fixed padding issue with dates (padding with a zero)
- pypi support

## [1.0.0] - 2017-04-21
### Added
- Drift option now supported inline as part of the cron
- using a plus (+) you can denote the drift entry in the cron. For example:
'0 /5 +4' is the same as writing '0 /5 * * * * 4'.  In this example we would
unblock every 5 minutes but drift an additional 4 seconds.  Inline drifting
allows multiple drifts such as '0 /5 +15,45' giving the same benifits as the
other fields do using this option.
- Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) support added (which is effectively
support for the standard cron format in addition to the enhanced one provided
by dateblock.
