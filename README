Datetools packages itself with 2 tools, dateblock and datemath.

Dateblock allows you to block until a period of time arrives
unlike 'sleep' which blocks for a set period of time. The difference
is very subtle but can prove to be useful. Python bindings can
additionally be installed for this too.

Datemath allows you to manipulate a date and or time by adding
and or subtracting to it. It can help with scripting and calculating
a specific date
